    Hi this is Maggie! I am a first-year master student at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm inspired by a future where AI and human creativity come together to build a world powered by smart solutions, blending technological progress with human values to create a society that's innovative, inclusive, and compassionate. And I'd love to be one of the “little builders” crafting this bold, imaginative future.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the "serious side", I like conducting research about how human and machine can make cooler decisions. On the "fun side", I am excited about building next Gen AI tools that can facilitate us. 
    For research, I'm an intern at Berkeley NLP Group guided by my amazing mentors Alane Suhr and Nicholas Tomlin. We explore how language agents can learn through interactions and collaborate with each other for optimal decisions.
    In free time I also work on an real-time AI interview assistant called <a href="https://beyz.ai/" target="_blank">Beyz</a> with my friends where I serve as Chief Scientist.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interest lies in the intersection of NLP and RL. Currently, I am interested in how language can be used to guide the learning of agents in complex environments through interaction.
